# Computer Vision Deep Learning
Group Project for the course at RUB

Project A: Making the Training Visible
The aim of this project is to visualize the process of adaptation of a neural network during training.
Train a neural network and examine the parameters during the optimization. For example (you can come
up with your own ideas): Store the weights of the lter masks in the rst layer over training time and
show them as little image patches. Store the 10 examples from the dataset that maximally or minimally
excite every neuron. Interpret the output of an entire dense layer as a point in a vector space, nd a
low-dimensional embedding, and visualize the representations in this low-dimensional vector space over
training time. Make the visualization accessible, look at your results, and point out what you see and
how this aligns with what you would have expected.
